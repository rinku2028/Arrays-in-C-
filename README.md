Arrays in C#



This section covers C# programming examples on Arrays. Every example program includes the description of the program, C# code as well as output of the program. All examples are compiled and tested on a Visual Studio. These examples can be simple C# programs or advanced C# programs. So, they are suitable for any user (dummies, beginners or advanced users).
Here is the listing of C# programming examples on Arrays.

1. C# Examples on different types of Arrays
An array is a variable that holds fixed number of values of a certain type. The no of elements an array can hold is called the length or the size of an array. It is used for looping and accessing over the last element. One dimensional array is the simplest type of array in C# that contains only one row to store value in same data type. A two-dimensional array contains two indices to select an element. An array whose elements are again arrays is called a Jagged Array. The elements of a jagged array are of different dimensions and sizes. The number of dimensions of an array is called its rank. Each dimension in an array has an upper and lower bound, which gives the range of values that can be used as subscripts for that dimension. The C# programs in this section performs conversion of a 2D array into 1D array, finds the length array length, determines the upper bound and lower bound of an array, evaluates the rank of a given array and demonstrates the functionalities of a jagged array.
